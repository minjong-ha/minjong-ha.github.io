This is Minjong-Ha's personal github page!!
===========================================

Nice to meet you!
----------------

# What I use to implement personal page?

I use "github.io" as a server, and "jekyll" as a page constructor.

First, I organize default and base structures and posts on vanila jekyll, and then I import jekyll template I like.


# How to test on local machine?

To test the personal page on local machine, exec the commands below

	cd docs/

	bundle exec jekyll serve

Thank you.
