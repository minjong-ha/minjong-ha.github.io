Git is essential teamwork tool.
When I managed git repository alone, what I had to know is a few commands.
However, working with team requires more systemical managing.

Followings are useful and essential git commands what I use frequently.

## Git commands for individual
<!-- git add / commit / push / pull -->

```
git add 
git commit 
git push
git pull
```

Above commands are basic commands for git.
It is useful even if there is a single developer to use.

<!-- git branch request --> 

```
git branch
git checkout
```

<!-- git rebase -i ${commit_uuid}  / squash -->

```
git rebase -i
```
