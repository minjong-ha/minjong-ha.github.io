# Abstract
oVirt is an open-source distributed virtualization solution, designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure. oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible. (https://www.ovirt.org/)
Usually, oVirt presents distributed system for the VMs and helps to deploy the cloud infrastructure.
In this post, I will explain how to deploy the oVirt and describe the architecture.
Then I will talk about why I tried to deploy oVirt: effective VM image changelog management.
