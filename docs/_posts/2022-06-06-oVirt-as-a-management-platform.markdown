# Abstract
oVirt is an open-source distributed virtualization solution, designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure. oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible. (https://www.ovirt.org/)
Usually, oVirt presents a distributed system for the VMs and helps to deploy the cloud infrastructure.
In this post, I will explain how to deploy the oVirt and describe the architecture.
Then I will talk about why I tried to deploy oVirt as an effective VM image footpring management.

# Introduction
Managing VM images is important since the users requires various image shape.
Differences in images may appear in the OS, in versions within the same OS, or in applications depending on usage within the same version.
VM service manager performs numerous major and minor updates and it causes fragmentation of images.
For this reason, We need to use an infrastructure to manage and update the images effectively.
