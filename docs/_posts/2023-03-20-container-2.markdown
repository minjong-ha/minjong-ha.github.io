In this post, I will install container platform on my raspberry pi and deploy multiple applications.

## What should I choose?

### Docker

Docker: Docker is a popular container platform that is widely used for building, packaging, and deploying containerized applications. It has official support for the Raspberry Pi, and there are many pre-built Docker images available for running on the Raspberry Pi.
Pros:

* Easy to use and deploy containers
* Large and active community of users and developers
* Official support for Raspberry Pi
* Many pre-built Docker images available

Cons:

* Resource-intensive, may not be suitable for low-powered Raspberry Pi models
* Requires some knowledge of containerization and Docker commands to use effectively

### Belena

Balena: Balena is a container platform designed specifically for IoT devices, including the Raspberry Pi. It includes tools for building and deploying containers, as well as a cloud-based dashboard for managing devices and applications.
Pros:

* Designed specifically for IoT devices, including Raspberry Pi
* Easy to use and deploy containers
* Cloud-based dashboard for managing devices and applications
* Supports both Docker and Kubernetes container formats

Cons:

* Requires a Balena account to use
* Limited free tier, may require a paid subscription for larger deployments

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes: Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform that provides tools for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications across a cluster of machines. It can be run on a Raspberry Pi cluster for small-scale deployments.

Pros:

* Provides advanced tools for managing containerized applications
* Supports large-scale deployments across a cluster of machines
* Widely used and supported by many cloud providers and vendors

Cons:

* Requires some knowledge of Kubernetes concepts and commands to use effectively
* Resource-intensive, may not be suitable for low-powered Raspberry Pi models
* Requires additional tools and configuration for running on a Raspberry Pi cluster

### LXC

LXC (Linux Containers) is a lightweight container platform that uses Linux kernel features to provide containerization capabilities. It can be used on the Raspberry Pi, but it is not as popular as Docker or Kubernetes.

Here are some pros and cons of using LXC on Raspberry Pi:

Pros:

* Lightweight and efficient, suitable for low-powered Raspberry Pi models
* Easy to use and deploy containers
* Provides a high degree of isolation between containers
* Supports a wide range of Linux distributions and applications

Cons:

* Limited community support compared to Docker and Kubernetes
* Requires some knowledge of Linux containers and LXC commands to use effectively
* Limited support for advanced features like load balancing and resource management
