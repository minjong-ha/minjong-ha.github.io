I have an interest in 'eBPF'.
Let's figure it out.

## Introduction

### BPF

'BPF (Berkely Packet Filter)' is an in-kernel virtual machine that analyzing packets with packet fileter.
BPF has virtual registers and stack and execute codes based on it.
JIT (Just In-Time) compiler makes BPF commands run directly on the processor.

'eBPF (extended BPF)' takes one more step.
It has larger register, stack and map.
