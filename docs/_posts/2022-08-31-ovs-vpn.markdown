## Abstract

In this post, I will explain What the OvS is and how can we utilize it on the multi-VM machine.

Suppose that there is a computer that should be connected with seperated, independent network for each VMs.
Host OS can manage the networks with OvS and seperates them logically.
Since the target networks are located in the private network, host should consider the VPN handling from VMs.


## Introduction

## Open vSwitch (OvS)

Open vSwitch implements virtual, software based switch instead of physical switch.
OvS can support multiple virtual NICs(vNIC) with single physical NIC cable

<!---OvS example image --->

Above image represents the overall architecture of OvS applied system.
There are multiple VMs with different purposes, and OvS supports them by providing virtual NICs.

## Target Design

The goal is logically seperated multi-VMs environment.
Each VMs should looks like located in the private network.

Fortunately, libvirt supports ovs network bridge for KVM.

```
<network>
  <name>test</name>
  <forward mode='bridge'/>
  <bridge name='internal-br'/>
  <virtualport type='openvswitch'/>
  <portgroup name='vlan-01' default='yes'>
  </portgroup>
</network>
```

Following xml represents the libvirt network supporting ovs bridge.
Unlike the original network xml has information about the network itself, ovs network xml only contains the name of bridge and virtual port type.
