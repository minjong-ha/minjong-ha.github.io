## Abstract

In this post, I will explain What the OvS is and how can we utilize it on the multi-VM machine.

Suppose that there is a computer that should be connected with seperated, independent network for each VMs.
Host OS can manage the networks with OvS and seperates them logically.
Since the target networks are located in the private network, host should consider the VPN handling from VMs.


## Introduction

## Open vSwitch (OvS)

Open vSwitch implements virtual, software based switch instead of physical switch.
OvS can support multiple virtual NICs(vNIC) with single physical NIC cable

Above image represents the overall architecture of OvS applied system.

## Target Design

The goal is logically seperated multi-VMs environment.
Each VMs looks like located in the private network.
