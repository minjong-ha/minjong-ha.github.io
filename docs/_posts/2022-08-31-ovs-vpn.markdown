## Abstract

In this post, I will explain What the OvS is and how can we utilize it on the multi-VM machine.

Suppose that there is a computer that should be connected with seperated, independent network for each VMs.
Host OS can manage the networks with OvS and seperates them logically.
Since the target networks are located in the private network, host should consider the VPN handling from VMs.
