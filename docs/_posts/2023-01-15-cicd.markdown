"CI/CD" is method to frequently deliever application to customers with automated, continuous delivery and deployment.
It is convinient not only for the customers but developers.
In project, source codes are frequently, oftenly updated, roll-backed, merged, and branched.
More the developers participate the project, it beyonds the limit that human can manage.
As a result, "CI/CD" can automate the system and presents organized management.

In this post, I will share my experience and trial about the "CI/CD" with Github Actions.


## Github Actions

Github Action presents the automated tasks that triggered by pull request (merge request), push and etc.
It can build or compile the source codes and test when the repository is pushed by locals.
It also provide cron jobs that executing certain scripts with schedule.
