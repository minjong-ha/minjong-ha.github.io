`flatpak` is an open-source software providing a framework for development, packaging and distributing application.
It uses a sandboxing approach to isolate the applications from host system.
Applications are packaged with their dependencies and installed easily on different linux distributions (less compatibility issue).

## Install

To run a flatpak-based application, you need to install `flatpak` first.

In [`flatpak` setup page](https://flatpak.org/setup/), you can find linux distributions(icons) from the list.
For example, I can see following instructions on `Debian`:

```bash
apt install flatpak
```

```bash
apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
```

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

## Electron

Many electron-based applications were already distributed through the `flatpak`.
To package and distribute an electron application, you need to create a `flatpak` manifest file.
It describes the application, dependencies and build instruction.

Now, create the `flatpak` manifest:

```json
{
  "app-id": "com.yourcompany.yourapp",
  "runtime": "org.freedesktop.Platform",
  "runtime-version": "20.08",
  "sdk": "org.freedesktop.Sdk",
  "command": "your-app-name",
  "finish-args": [
    "--share=ipc",
    "--socket=x11",
    "--socket=pulseaudio",
    "--filesystem=home"
  ],
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "your-app-name",
      "buildsystem": "simple",
      "build-commands": [
        "install -Dm755 your-app-name.sh /app/bin/your-app-name"
      ],
      "sources": [
        {
          "type": "dir",
          "path": "your-app-directory"
        },
        {
          "type": "script",
          "commands": [
            "exec /app/your-app-directory/your-app-name \"$@\""
          ],
          "dest-filename": "your-app-name.sh"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration

`flatpak` allows to customize that how application is running, including network access.

Followings are options for network access:

```bash
--share=network
--unshare=network
```

### `--share=network`

This option grants the application access to the network.
If it is not included in `finish-args`, the application cannot access to network.

### `--unshare=network`

This option denies the application access to the network.

```bash
sudo ip netns add my_namespace

sudo ip link set dev my_ovs_bridge netns my_namespace

sudo ip netns exec my_namespace flatpak run com.example.myapp
```
