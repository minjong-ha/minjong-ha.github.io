`flatpak` is an open-source software providing a framework for development, packaging and distributing application.
It uses a sandboxing approach to isolate the applications from host system.
Applications are packaged with their dependencies and installed easily on different linux distributions (less compatibility issue).

## Install

To run a flatpak-based application, you need to install `flatpak` first.

In [`flatpak` setup page](https://flatpak.org/setup/), you can find linux distributions(icons) from the list.
For example, I can see following instructions on `Debian`:

```bash
apt install flatpak
```

```bash
apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
```

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```
